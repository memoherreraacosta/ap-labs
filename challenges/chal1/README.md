First code challenge
===============

Instructions of the challenge :

  - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

  -- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: "abcabcbb"
  Output: 3   
  ```
  Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 


  -- Example 2:

  ```
  Input: "bbbbb"
  Output: 1
  ```
  Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.


  -- Example 3:
  
  ```
  Input: "pwwkew"
  Output: 3
  ```
  Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
    
  Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

===============

To run the code, you need to have :

- Jupyter notebook installed (if not, you can download it from https://jupyter.org/install )
- The "First Code Challenge" download it from the repository or directly from the source ( https://github.com/memoherreraacosta/ap-labs/blob/master/challenges/chal1/First%20Code%20Challenge.ipynb )

Once its installed, press the command: ```jupyter notebook``` in your terminal to open Jupyter, find the "First Code Challenge" and run it.

The program will ask you a word to be tested, and the code will print the result.
