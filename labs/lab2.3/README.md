Lab 2.3 - Cross-referencer
==========================

Write a cross-referencer in C that prints a list of all words in a document, and, for each word, a list of the line numbers on which it occurs. Remove noise words like `the`, `and`, and so on.

```
./cross-ref document.txt
```

General Requirements and Considerations
---------------------------------------
- Use the `cross-ref.c` file for your implementation.
- Update `README.md` with the proper steps for building and running your code.
- Follow the command-line arguments convention.
- Don't forget to handle errors properly.
- Coding best practices implementation will be also considered.

Test cases
----------
Your program will be tested with the following txt-based books.
