Was founded as the Barcelona's reserve team in 1970 with the merge of Condal (Barcelona's previous reserve team) and Atlètic Catalunya. Castilla was founded as Real Madrid's reserve team in 1972, after the folding of A. D. Plus Ultra (Real Madrid's previous reserve team). Both teams would meet for the first time during the third round of the 197475 Copa del Generalísimo and then again during the 198283 Segunda División season.
The reserve teams normally meet only when both are competing in the second tier, as they are placed in different regional groups at lower levels, and they are not permitted to enter the Copa del Rey.
